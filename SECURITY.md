# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We actively maintain and provide security updates for the following versions of Pull Request Report:

| Version | Supported          | Notes                    |
| ------- | ------------------ | ------------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | :white_check_mark: | Current stable release   |
| main    | :white_check_mark: | Development branch       |

## Security Considerations

### Data Privacy
- **Local Operation**: All analysis runs locally on your machine
- **No Data Transmission**: Your code and PR data never leave your environment
- **GitHub API**: Only uses GitHub's official API with your authenticated access
- **Reports Storage**: Generated reports are stored locally and gitignored by default

### Dependencies
- **Python Packages**: Uses well-maintained packages (weasyprint, typer, rich)
- **uvx Execution**: Leverages uv's secure package isolation
- **GitHub CLI**: Relies on official GitHub CLI for API access
- **No Secrets**: Tool doesn't handle or store authentication secrets directly

### File System Access
- **Read-Only GitHub Data**: Only reads PR data via GitHub API
- **Local Write Access**: Writes reports to local `reports/` directory only
- **Script Execution**: Shell scripts have minimal system interaction
- **No Elevated Privileges**: Runs with standard user permissions
