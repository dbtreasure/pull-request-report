## Prerequisites

1. **Claude Code** - Install from [claude.ai/code](https://claude.ai/code)
2. **GitHub CLI** - Install with:
   - macOS: `brew install gh`

Just tell Claude: **"Set me up"**

Claude will:

3. **Your role** in each repository (e.g., "Frontend engineer", "API developer")
4. **What you want to improve** (e.g., "async patterns", "code organization")

## Your First Analysis

After setup, just say: **"Analyze my recent PRs"**

Claude will create detailed reports in the `reports/` folder showing:
- What reviewers commented on

## Tips

- Start with analyzing your last 5-10 PRs
