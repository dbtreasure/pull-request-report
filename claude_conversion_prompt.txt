I need to convert a PR analysis markdown summary to styled HTML matching a specific template, with fidelity verification.

**Task Overview:**
Convert the markdown summary at `reports/paxton-app-api/summary.md` to HTML matching the visual style of `pr_analysis_pdf.html`, then verify conversion fidelity.

**Specific Requirements:**
1. Read `reports/paxton-app-api/summary.md` and understand its content structure
2. Read `pr_analysis_pdf.html` to understand the CSS styling patterns  
3. Convert the markdown to HTML using the same visual styling approach
4. Map content appropriately to CSS classes (overview-box, pattern-section, issues-list, improvements-list, strengths-list, recommendations, focus-areas, conclusion, etc.)
5. Preserve ALL original information - no additions, no omissions
6. Verify conversion fidelity by comparing original and converted content
7. Save the HTML output as `reports/paxton-app-api/analysis-report.html`
8. Generate PDF using available tools (weasyprint or wkhtmltopdf)

**Key Styling Guidelines from Template:**
- Use overview-box for introductory content with PR lists
- Use pattern-section for main analysis sections  
- Use issues-list (red border) for problems/recurring issues
- Use improvements-list (green border) for improvement actions
- Use strengths-list (blue border) for positive observations
- Use recommendations (orange border) for actionable recommendations
- Use focus-areas (purple border) for future focus areas
- Use conclusion (green border) for summary/conclusion
- Maintain proper spacing, typography, and print-friendly formatting

**Critical Quality Checks:**
- Verify no content is lost or added during conversion
- Ensure proper HTML structure and CSS class usage
- Validate that visual hierarchy matches content importance
- Confirm all sections are appropriately styled
- Check that the output is both web and print-friendly

Please proceed with this conversion process step by step, ensuring high fidelity to the original content while achieving professional visual presentation.
