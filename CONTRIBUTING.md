### Local Development
```bash
# 1. Fork and clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/pull-request-report
cd pull-request-report

# 2. Set up development environment
./scripts/setup.sh

# 3. Run tests to ensure everything works
./scripts/test.sh

# 4. Make your changes
# Edit files as needed

# 5. Test your changes

```

## üìù Code Guidelines

### Code Style
- **Python**: Follow PEP 8, use type hints where appropriate
- **Shell Scripts**: Use `set -e` for error handling, quote variables
- **Markdown**: Use consistent formatting, check links
- **Tests**: Write tests for new functionality, maintain existing test structure

### File Organization
- **Core functionality**: `pull_request_report/` directory
- **Scripts**: `scripts/` directory with executable permissions
- **Tests**: `test/` directory with realistic fixtures
- **Documentation**: Root level markdown files

### Testing Requirements
All contributions must include appropriate tests:
- **Unit tests**: For individual functions and components
- **Integration tests**: For full workflow testing
- **Test fixtures**: Realistic sample data when needed
- **All existing tests must pass**

### Commit Guidelines
Follow conventional commit format:
```
type(scope): description

Examples:
feat: add support for GitLab repositories
fix: resolve PDF generation on Windows
docs: update installation instructions
test: add tests for configuration validation
```
